Feedback:
  - a lot of moving between windows (try to make windows less intrusive)

- Getting it out there
  - Get others to try it out (maybe noblelemon, post stuff in libgdx discord, have friends test)
    - Create something (google form probably) that allows me to get structured feedback from people about the game 
    - Create an information log that gets sent to me through api calls with debug information/playtest information perhaps?
    - Add a report/suggest feature into the game? maybe make it go through api.coltenreissmann.me
  - Make a simple trailer: grab attention at the beginning, showcase the music and gameplay, end with call to action.
  - Post teasers and short clips. Maybe make some devlog videos

1.2 TODO LIST:
- Bestiary
  - Keep it simple to understand with a lot of icons to signify immunities, health, money on death, other effects
  - A short description
- Create effect towers (similar to beacons in factorio)
  - Distributor that applies a fraction of a gemstone's power to towers in range
  - Magnetic Tower that increases the likelihood of an enemy dropping a component when killed within range
  - Other towers that increase tower stats
- More levels
- Add a "No breaks" option, which disables all preperation time as a challenge option. It would give more currency as a reward.
- Add player customization options.
  - Make a money system outside of inside of a level (like geobits!!!!) that are granted for completing achievements and playing levels
  - Allow them to color their avatar (use the custom shader to do this)
  - Accessories shop
  - Custom nametag colors/effects
- Create a compact version of the shop (toggleable in the settings. it should be just icons and tabs, similar to necesse inventory?)
- New competitive mode: Offensive
  // All combative and mining towers are the same. Players will have access to an attacking window, 
  // which allows them to send enemies over to the other team with money.
  - Add a market tower, which passively generates money (this tower will be vital to the new offensive gamemode, as it will be how players initially generate money)
- User-friendly editor
- Stock Market Tower!!!!
- mining for money
- When playing a campaign level for the first time, display the new towers that are available to use.
  - Create an animation that grays out the screen and displays the new towers in the middle (like the infininode tutorial)
  - Put the tower's description underneath
  - After pressing continue, have the images shrink and move towards the shop icon
- Re-implement passwords to enter online games
- New Tower: Sniper Tower (large damage, slow attack speed. past a certain level (or maybe with quartz applied), you should unlock the ability to target specific enemies with this tower).
- Add a maximum towers setting in WavesData (for multiplayer and map making)
- Create uses for surplus gemstones
- In-game chat/message log
- Make the title screen more interactive and nice to look at
  - Make the background interesting. Video background? Image slideshow? Factorio-like live background?
  - Create main menu music
