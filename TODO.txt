1.0 TODO LIST: 
- Create some mining towers and have them add items to team inventories
  - component escavator that discovers more burried components
  ✓ gemstone miner that uncovers gemstones (only one gemstone can be applied to a building and provides special abilities and perks)
  ✓ material miner that produces metals (DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY'RE PLACED) like steel, which can be used to construct/upgrade special towers

- Finish Campaign / 1.3
- Add achievements to the game (MAKE SURE THEY'RE UNIQUE AND NOT SOLELY USED TO INCREASE GAME TIME)
  - Add an achievement complete notification that appears at the top of the screen. (make it work in any menu)
  - Add an achievement window in the main menu (overlay a checkmark over the icon of the achievement if it is completed)
- Add a way to display if a tower is an enemy tower

1.1 TODO LIST:
- Bestiary
  - Keep it simple to understand with a lot of icons to signify immunities, health, money on death, other effects
  - A short description
- Create effect towers (similar to beacons in factorio)
  - Distributor that applies a fraction of a gemstone's power to towers in range
  - Magnetic Tower that increases the likelihood of an enemy dropping a component when killed within range
  - Other towers that increase tower stats
- More levels
- Add a "No breaks" option, which disables all preperation time as a challenge option. It would give more currency as a reward.
- Add player customization options.
  - Make a money system outside of inside of a level (like geobits!!!!) that are granted for completing achievements and playing levels
  - Allow them to color their avatar (might need to learn how to shift hues to do this)
  - Accessories shop
  - Custom nametag colors
- Create a compact version of the shop (toggleable in the settings. it should be just icons and tabs, similar to necesse inventory?)
- New competitive mode: Offensive
  // All combative and mining towers are the same. Players will have access to an attacking window, 
  // which allows them to send enemies over to the other team with money.
  - Add a market tower, which passively generates money (this tower will be vital to the new offensive gamemode, as it will be how players initially generate money)
