ORDERED TODO LIST:
✓ Create a "Game Over" screen for multiplayer and singleplayer modes (don't further support players playing past the game's end)
  ✓ Implement a score system as well
✓ Create tabs for shop menu to separate combative towers, mining towers, and effect towers
✓ Add new tiles to prepare for mining towers to be implemented
  ✓ Add ore veins (IRON, TITANIUM, URANIUM, ETC) for the material miner
  ✓ Add ONE gemstone-rich tile for gemstone miners to use 
- Create some mining towers and have them add items to team inventories
  - component escavator that discovers more burried components
  ✓ gemstone miner that uncovers gemstones (only one gemstone can be applied to a building and provides special abilities and perks)
  ✓ material miner that produces metals (DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY'RE PLACED) like steel, which can be used to construct/upgrade special towers
✓ Add gemstone functionality
  ✓ Diamonds adds piercing to towers
  ✓ Cryonite inflicts slowness debuffs on enemies that are hit by it
  ✓ Quartz increases range of buildings
  ✓ Topaz halves attack speed, but doubles range and damage
  ✓ Thorium halves damage, but doubles attack speed and AOE
  ✓ Ruby has a chance to double the damage of towers (crit chance)
- (Optionally) Create effect towers (similar to beacons in factorio)
  - Distributor that applies a fraction of a gemstone's power to towers in range
  - Magnetic Tower that increases the likelihood of an enemy dropping a component when killed within range
  - Other towers that increase tower stats
- Create worlds instead of levels
  - Replace the current level selector with a system like Infinitode 2, New Super Mario Bros U, etc.
  - Players must complete either X amounts of waves if the level is endless OR finish the predefined waves to move on
  - In the menu, have a button that allows you to toggle between "Online" and "Singleplayer"
  - Create a story world for the base game ALONG WITH a competitive world for multiplayer
- Make ~5 good base game levels (try not to do endless) and ~2 player levels
- Create a tutorial button in the play menu for new players
- Add a bestiary for players to learn more about the enemies they encounter 
  - Keep it simple to understand with a lot of icons to signify immunities, health, money on death, other effects
- Add achievements to the game (MAKE SURE THEY'RE UNIQUE AND NOT SOLELY USED TO INCREASE GAME TIME)
- Add player customization options
  - Make a money system outside of inside of a level (like geobits!!!!) that are granted for completing achievements and playing levels
  - Allow them to color their avatar (might need to learn how to shift hues)
  - Custom nametag colors

  REMEMBER TO:
  - incorporate the time aspect of the game as much as possible (mining towers should produce after a certain amount of time, not just RNG)
  - probably come up with a name

- Bestiary
- More (better) levels
- Achievements
- Mining/Automation Element of the game (buildings dedicated to mining)
- In competitive modes, allow players to send enemies to the other side (even during cooldown periods) and decrease the endless mode impact on the game slightly

- Make left shift force insert component instead of showing the dialog 
- More music
- Consider: should fire and ice deal more damage?
- Improve shop layout (ADD TABS)
- ADD LOSE/WIN SCREEN (where you can reset or play again)
- {
  Instead of having a level selector, create a world where levels can be selected (similar to the diner dash worlds or new super mario bros u).
  To progress in the world, you must either complete the predefined waves in a non-endless level OR get to a certain level in endless mode
}

IDEAS:
- Resources can be obtained through mining/drilling in order to build/upgrade towers
- GEMS obtained from mining can be applied to structures to give them buffs (one gem per tower)
  - examples of this: 
  -   Diamond=piercing bullets for shooter towers
  -   Ruby=sets every other enemy on fire
  -   Sapphire?=halves attack speed, doubles range and doubles damage
