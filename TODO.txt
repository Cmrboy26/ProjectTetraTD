  Feedback:
  - a lot of moving between windows (try to make windows less intrusive)

1.2 TODO LIST:
- Bestiary
  - Keep it simple to understand with a lot of icons to signify immunities, health, money on death, other effects
  - A short description
- Create effect towers (similar to beacons in factorio)
  - Distributor that applies a fraction of a gemstone's power to towers in range
  - Magnetic Tower that increases the likelihood of an enemy dropping a component when killed within range
  - Other towers that increase tower stats
- More levels
- Add a "No breaks" option, which disables all preperation time as a challenge option. It would give more currency as a reward.
- Add player customization options.
  - Make a money system outside of inside of a level (like geobits!!!!) that are granted for completing achievements and playing levels
  - Allow them to color their avatar (might need to learn how to shift hues to do this)
  - Accessories shop
  - Custom nametag colors
- Create a compact version of the shop (toggleable in the settings. it should be just icons and tabs, similar to necesse inventory?)
- New competitive mode: Offensive
  // All combative and mining towers are the same. Players will have access to an attacking window, 
  // which allows them to send enemies over to the other team with money.
  - Add a market tower, which passively generates money (this tower will be vital to the new offensive gamemode, as it will be how players initially generate money)
- Stock Market Tower!!!!
- mining for money
